The library is close to Ashby BART station. See below for parking information.</p> <p>This meetup will be a self-directed programming session without a fixed plan or leader. Just bring whatever tutorials, books, courses, or projects that you\\'re working on. You can meet people, find a partner for pair programming, talk about technology, or just work on a project or tutorial. All levels are welcome.</p> <p>Optional activity: if you want to work on coding puzzles, projects, and/or study groups with other attendees, let an organizer know when you arrive or just ask around.</p> <p>Sometimes there are short lightning talk presentations (5-10 minutes long) at the beginning of the meetup. To submit a presentation idea, fill out this form: <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/presentations/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/presentations/</a></p> <p>Sometimes the meetings are quiet and sometimes there is talking. If you are depending on silence, you might want to bring headphones or earplugs.</p> <p>We usually walk over to a nearby cafe for more programming at 1 pm.</p> <p>Parking Information: There is free parking on the back streets near the library. If you head west on Russell Street for a couple of blocks, you should be able to find free all-day parking. There is also free parking to the north and east of the library. Keep an eye out for street sweeping signs.

Director of Bioinformatics, UC San Diego</p> <p>Enabled by new genomics technologies, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) aims to create a resource where investigators can query cellular states in multiple tissues to better understand biological mechanisms and disease processes at the resolution of a single cell. We have created a Human Cell Atlas Notebook workspace, <a href=\"http://hca.genepattern.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://hca.genepattern.org</a>, built on the Jupyter Notebook environment and the GenePattern platform for integrative genomics, that hosts advanced analysis notebooks created by the HCA community, allows direct access to the HCA data from within a notebook, hosts compute-intensive analyses on the Amazon cloud, and provides many additional features allowing non-programming biologists and biomedical investigators to take advantage of this transformative resource.</p> <p>Event is co-sponsored by the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (<a href=\"https://datascience.ucsd.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://datascience.ucsd.edu/</a>) and the SDSC Data Science Hub (<a href=\"https://datascience.sdsc.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://datascience.sdsc.edu/</a>).</p>',\n",

I will give you the key to start using one of the most powerful cross platform framework to build user interfaces, the Qt project!, which now is officially supporting Python!</p> <p>###Short talk (15 mins)</p> <p>Using randomized controlled trials and AI to discover what makes a political ad persuasive, Valerie Coffman</p> <p>Swayable is a platform for predicting the persuasive impact of content launched in January of 2018. During the 2018 midterm election cycle, we tested over 500 political ads and surveyed over 300k people. As a result, we\\'ve amassed the most extensive data set we know of that links videos to their persuasive power. This talk will give an overview of how we gather and analyze data using Celery and Pandas, and our ongoing work using image recognition and natural language processing to extract insights into how to make a successful video ad.</p> <p>###Short talk (15mins)</p> <p>Make the Most of It: Negotiation and Self-Advocacy, Lusen Mendel</p> <p>Feeling confident about your work doesn’t automatically make you good at advocating for yourself. Many competent engineers avoid negotiating offers, asking for raises, or talking with managers about desired work responsibilities. However, negotiation and self-advocacy are an important part of any healthy employment relationship, and will allow you to make the most of your professional opportunities. This session is helpful for anyone who wants to strengthen their self-advocacy skills. Based on Lusen\\'s experience in engineering management and candidate coaching, you\\'ll walk away with knowledge and confidence for your next employment conversation.</p> <p>###Main talk (25mins)</p> <p>Python Decorators and Diversions, Richard Haven</p> <p>Python decorators are an easy way to add meta and mixin behavior to code. They can enhance functions, methods, and even whole classes. And once you can get your head around function variables, they are pretty straight-forward. With one exception.<br/>Learn how the mechanism works so you can add timing, caching, security, metrics, and more to any part of your code.</p> <p>##AGENDA</p> <p>6:00p - Check-in and mingle, with food provided by our generous sponsor!</p> <p>7:05p - Welcome</p> <p>7:30p - Door close</p> <p>7:10p - Announcements, lightning talks and main talk</p> <p>8:15p - More mingling</p> <p>9:30p - Hard stop</p> <p>This event is produced by:</p> <p>*SF Python, a volunteers-run organization aiming to foster the Python Community in the Bay Area. Please check out their flagship event, [PyBay2019](<a href=\"https://pybay.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://pybay.com</a>), 4th Annual Regional Python Conference in SF on August 15-18.*</p> <p>*Yelp sees 89 million mobile users and 79 million desktop users every month. Keeping everything running smoothly requires the best and brightest in the industry. Their engineers come from diverse technical backgrounds and value digital craftsmanship, open-source, and creative problem-solving. They write tests, review code, and push multiple times a day.

Democratization of deep learning libraries and frameworks enable data scientists and machine learning engineers to apply state-of-the-art algorithms to solve high-valued business challenges. However, it is not trivial to stand up such a development environment with GPU and necessary libraries installed.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will discuss how to quickly stand up a deep learning experiment environment on Azure Databricks using the Databricks Runtime for ML. It includes native support for popular Python deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, as well as OpenCV and PIL for computer vision and image processing. This runtime enables an immediate environment to overcome some common challenges practitioners face in getting started with deep learning.

In his spare time he does projects involving NLP and causal inference.</p> <p>Social media is now where public opinion forms, and sports are an easily quantifiable way to analyze public opinion. In this project, I wanted to understand why certain athletes are popular on social media; specifically, how performance (e.g. points) and other demographic characteristics (age, race) influence popularity. To do this, I scraped millions of comments off reddit, and used sentiment analysis to measure how popular each athlete was. Then I used the econometric technique multivariate regression to understand which factors underly popularity. The basic results were that high scoring, young, and old athletes were popular. In terms of biases, I found that high scoring white players were popular, and there was a bias against black coaches.</p> <p>Tim Crosley will be giving his talk \"Validating Uncertain Data\"</p> <p>Tim Crosley is a software engineer at Domain Tools and maintainer of several notable Open Source Python projects.</p> <p>Many of us, as software developers, value certainty and control. And those of us who are or work with Data Scientists, know well the value of consistent, well structured, and clean data. Indeed, many validation and data processing libraries and platforms assume complete control and specification of data is possible. However, while we may all want well-structured data, for a variety of reasons, we can not always demand it. In this talk, I will go over common strategies for dealing with unstructured data in Python, as well as their pitfalls. I will then introduce attendees to a new approach that side-steps common issues and enables responding to changes in source data quality in real-time.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Your wonderful self.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>PuPPy has a Code of Conduct that applies to all PuPPy events and social spaces.

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll discuss the different visualization packages in Python, and walk through how to implement them while covering some key data science concepts.</p> <p>Suggested Experience Level:<br/>Beginner - some prior programming experience is helpful</p> <p>What to Bring:<br/>Laptop - this will ensure you get the most out of this workshop<br/>Water bottle</p> <p>How to find us: Tampa Bay Wave<br/>The event will be held at Tampa Bay Wave located at 500 E Kennedy Blvd #300, Tampa, FL 33602.

The do and don\\'ts [by Cintamani Puddu]</p> <p>Talk 2 outline<br/>A button to pause time: how to live outside the clock [by Sal Freudenberg and Clare Sudbery</p> <p>How does time impact on your working day? Would you like to hack time and live outside the clock? The answer is likely to be yes.</p> <p>In October 2018, Sal and Clare took an all-female team to Hack Manchester, built a time machine and won Best in Show. They are now taking their time machine on tour: You too can press the button and stop time. Have a nap, play tricks on your friends, or force the trains to be on time.</p> <p>Seriously though, repeated research has suggested the straitjacket of standard working hours does us all no good at all. Nor does the “always on” culture perpetuated by the speed of innovation and delivery in the world of software development. Yet we are all still stuck in our rigid working cultures. This light-hearted talk has a serious message: Don’t assume your teams have to be imprisoned by time. Try a little experimentation and see what a difference you can make when you play with expectations and give your people some time-based freedom.</p> <p>Time travel for the win!</p> <p>About Sal Freudenberg<br/>Dr. Sal Freudenberg is the Chief Being Sal Officer at Cucumber Ltd and has a PhD in the Psychology of Collaborative Software Development. Sal is also the co-founder of the Inclusive Collaboration Campaign and when she’s not hacking or strategizing she is busy raising awareness of the benefits of neurodiversity and helping the industry begin to understand how to support and include every kind of brain.</p> <p>About Clare Sudbery<br/>Clare Sudbery is a lead consultant developer with ThoughtWorks. She is a maths graduate with 19 years of software engineering experience, and a particular interest in teaching and mentoring, encouraging more women into IT and banishing impostor syndrome.</p> <p>Seven years ago she returned to IT with a sigh of relief after a few years as a high school maths teacher. Since then she has embraced all things XP. She is on a mission to awaken the inner geek in clever women (and men) everywhere.

We will start arriving at the bar about 9:00pm, and we should be there for at least an hour or two. Map: <a href=\"https://binged.it/2PRyrZ7\" class=\"linkified\">https://binged.it/2PRyrZ7</a></p> <p>The Omni Hotel offers discounted parking - $7 if you park after 5pm. Remember to grab a validation ticket from Capital Factory staff.</p> <p>There also tends to be lots of street parking a little bit north of the Omni building.</p> <p>Agenda<br/>========</p> <p>- 7:00pm - Doors open<br/>- 7:30pm - Main presentation<br/>- 8:15pm - Second presentation<br/>- 9:00pm - Retire to a local bar for further discussion<br/>(times approximate)</p> <p>Food + drinks will be provided. Our food &amp; beverage sponsor this month is Anaconda (once again), who is still hiring for roles here in Austin, Berlin, and NYC:</p> <p>Content<br/>========</p> <p>Our main presentation this month is by Cam Herringshaw.</p> <p>What You Should Know About DevOps - The Importance of Company Culture</p> <p>DevOps has come into the popular vocabulary in software engineering in recent years, but the underlying principles are actually much older, growing out of the industrial manufacturing industry\\'s Lean Manufacturing movement. Today, a lot of companies focus on the software and technical aspects of DevOps, but gloss over the cultural aspects that allowed Lean to thrive. This presentation will go over the Three Ways of DevOps, the importance of company culture to each, and how to form the right culture around your development and operations teams, as well as pitfalls to avoid when building DevOps into your company culture.</p> <p>After our main presentation Danny Mulligan will lead a discussion on how we can create content for future APUG meetups, and look for ideas on how we can make the meetup better for everyone.</p>',\n",

To improve undergraduate music education, we have developed a combination of novel data pre-processing and user-directed pattern finding that make it possible to reach the full potential of Martin Wattenberg’s 2001 vision for seeing the \"Shape of Song\" (<a href=\"http://www.bewitched.com/song.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bewitched.com/song.html</a>). Through the ATAVizM course module, students create compelling visualizations to accompany their analytical papers, but more importantly they learn how analytical processes may be implemented as algorithms.</p> <p>Musical themes and motives are often transposed or otherwise modified in the course of a piece. An example is the subject and answer of a fugue (an imitative polyphonic composition). How do we formalize the relationship between a subject and tonal answer? Or, the improvisational “licks” of Dizzy Gillespie? Such that we could define “themes” as a category that may be formalized computationally? Especially, when a computer does not know where to look for themes or what modifications to expect? We discuss how algorithms informed by humanistic understanding of music can work much better than those that are not.</p> <p>Bios:</p> <p>Dr. Aaron Carter-Ényì teaches at Morehouse College and Spelman College. He holds a PhD from Ohio State University (2016), 2017 fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and a two-time Fulbright recipient (Nigeria, 2012 and 2019). He is the director of the Africana Digital Ethnography Project (ADEPt), funded by ACLS and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and is currently developing ATAVizM, funded by NEH.</p> <p>William Dula is a Master\\'s Student in the Applied Mathematics program at Clark Atlanta University. William began working with ADEPt/ATAVizM as an undergraduate research assistant at Morehouse College. William\\'s mathematical research focuses on creating innovative numerical methods for solving physical systems. William is also interested in studying linguistics through mathematics, specifically sentiment analysis.</p> <p>Jerry Volcy is director of Spelman’s Innovation Lab and Brown-Simmons Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. Dr. Volcy graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1996 whereupon he joined Lucent Bell Labs as head of Intelligent Machines and Controls Laboratory, IMAC, in Norcross, Georgia.

       "  'description': '<p>Configuring Kubernetes authorization policies with RBAC is an important part of securing any cluster. Unfortunately implementing effective and maintainable policies can be quite challenging. Many organizations end up struggling with a common set of challenges as they try to implement RBAC across their clusters. These challenges have often resulted in insecure configuration that grants far more access than necessary.</p> <p>In this talk, Rob will highlight open source tools and best practices that address many of these common challenges. This presentation aims to make RBAC more approachable for all, and will provide a straightforward path toward effective and maintainable configuration that can make your cluster more secure.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Rob Scott works with the team at ReactiveOps where he focuses on all things Kubernetes. He was an author of the recent “CI/CD with Kubernetes” ebook published by The New Stack. With a wide variety of experience in software engineering and architecture, he developed a passion for Kubernetes that was only increased when he witnessed the resiliency it provided during an AWS service disruption. He loves to speak about Kubernetes and has been featured in the \"This Is My Architecture\" series by AWS.</p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>Op donderdag 9 mei 2019 zijn front-enders, leden van de front-end vakvereniging Fronteers en andere ambachtslieden van het wereldwijde web welkom bij Kabisa in Weert. De bijeenkomst is gratis en voor iedereen toegankelijk, je hoeft je alleen even in te schrijven.</p> <p>We hebben de volgende talks voor je geselecteerd:</p> <p>Design Systems: where designers and developers meet - Bart Berden &amp; Leon de Rijke</p> <p>Je hebt het vast weleens meegemaakt: \"Kan je deze button even iets verder naar rechts zetten?\", \"Het ziet er heel anders uit dan het Photoshop bestand dat ik heb aangeleverd!\", \"Hier moet eigenlijk nog net iets meer witruimte tussen.\", etc. etc.</p> <p>Vaak reikt de communicatie tussen designers en developers niet verder dan dit. Met een Design System is dit verleden tijd. Een Design System bestaat uit een collectie van herbruikbare componenten én bijbehorende richtlijnen voor het gebruik van die componenten. De componenten uit het Design System voeg je samen om een applicatie of website te bouwen.</p> <p>Bart (designer) en Leon (developer) delen hun ervaringen met het ontwerpen en implementeren van Design Systems. In deze talk leer je o.a. waarom een Styleguide nog geen Design System is, hoe je een Design System implementeert én hoe je je organisatie zover krijgt om een Design System te omarmen.</p> <p>Property based testing in JavaScript - Luc Tielen</p> <p>Als developers zijn we gewend om testen te schrijven, eventueel in een TDD workflow (Test Driven Development), om het gedrag van onze applicaties en libraries te valideren. Alle test cases moeten op voorhand bedacht en uitgeschreven worden, waardoor de code enkel in de bedachte omstandigheden getest wordt.<br/>Property Based Testing probeert dit op te lossen door developers het gedrag van de code uit te laten drukken in properties (invariants), waarmee automatisch tests gegenereerd kunnen worden die deze eigenschappen valideren.</p> <p>In deze talk zal Luc de basis concepten van Property Based Testing uitleggen en toelichten met voorbeelden, van eenvoudige snippets tot meer geavanceerde ‘real life’ voorbeelden.</p> <p>Intro to Reason - Pascal Widdershoven</p> <p>Reason(ML) is een functionele programmeertaal met een static type system.

However<br/>• It wasn’t very flexible: building new features would often require the addition of fields and associations which would cause response sizes to grow everywhere even though they weren’t used everywhere.<br/>• Caching of whole objects would sometimes cause requests to spend more time fetching the cache than building the response from scratch. This is partly due to our serialization library’s caching strategy of fetching individual objects rather than batching</p> <p>The backend team sought to try out GraphQL as an alternative to give clients just what they needed. Brian will present a summary of how he went about developing a GraphQL API and his learnings along the way.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Bio: Brian Underwood is a Platform Engineer at Fishbrain. In previous lives he has been a full-stack Rails engineer, a developer advocate for Neo4j, and a researcher of text analytics solutions. He enjoys simple languages and complex problems.</p> <p>19:00- 19:10 Break</p> <p>19:10 - 19:55 Refactoring an oldish iOS App to GraphQL by Tim Sneed</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>A lot has changed in the iOS landscape since Fishbrain was first launched on the App Store in 2012. One thing that had not was the decision to use a REST API. In this talk Tim will share some decisions, problems, and solutions the iOS team made to pivot an existing app to start using GraphQL with the Apollo client.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Tim Sneed: iOS Developer/Engineering Manager at Fishbrain.

Me neither! Entering visual representations of recently-changed elements into version control makes a review of past changes easier &amp; speeds acclimation to a new web project, especially for visual learners. Surprisingly, methods for including images in your version control aren’t standardized and are rarely used outside of large companies, and the rest of us are left checking out every major commit and viewing changes locally! Join me for a review of methods currently in use and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each. The audience will learn from a survey of tools used by both designers and web developers, what methods are most appropriate for individual projects, &amp; how these methods differ from those used at some of the largest companies (Google, eBay, etc.). Finding a method to track changes in your visual elements will save our future contributors (and future selves!) the pain of having to distinguish #2dc651 (lime green) from #34a34e (darker(!) lime green) and ultimately make our commit histories cleaner and our repos easier to navigate in ways that many of us have never imagined!”</p>',\n",

       "  'description': \"<p>Dean will be talking about testing react components/applications:</p> <p>Unit testing usually makes up the largest portion of a project's automated tests. React's approach to components and its functional-friendly style mean that it is easier than ever to write unit tests for your UI. This is great news now that CI/CD pipelines are becoming commonplace for our web apps.</p> <p>There are still plenty of questions to be discussed, though. When every line of code we write imposes a maintenance burden for all of eternity, we need to think carefully about what should be tested and how many tests should be written? Are there any special considerations when testing React components? How do new APIs like hooks and context affect our ability to write tests?</p> <p>In this report from the trenches, I'll discuss what has worked for our group as we try to strike the right balance between pragmatism and completeness in our production applications.</p> <p>Dean Iverson is the client applications lead in the Center for Technology Implementation at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. CTI's focus is to help our clients bridge the gap between pure R&amp;D and the initial deployment of new technologies in the real world. These days, most of our work involves writing software to support research on connected and autonomous vehicle technologies.</p> <p>6:00-6:30 pizza, socializing and networking<br/>6:30-7:30 presentation and questions</p> <p>Pizza generously provided by Teksystems</p> <p>Space generously provided by Desk Chair</p>\",\n",

Businesses use NLP to create systems like chatbots, machine translation, spam detection, named entity recognition, speech recognition, document summarization, and many more. Join us to learn more about these two powerful libraries. spaCy and gensim are powerful Python libraries that make processing textual data a breeze!</p> <p>No previous exposure to these libraries is assumed!</p> <p>Note: This event will be substantially similar to the event we held on natural language processing, spacy and gensim on April 16th, 2019, but you are certainly welcome to join us again if you\\'d like!</p>',\n",

It will be our first crack at embedded device security as a group. For more details- come see PASCAL next Thursday!</p> <p>For the second part of this hardware challenge, we will be taking an indepth look at the device ROM and MCU. We will be using the MiniPro chip reader, and again working with TTL converters.</p> <p>**END NOTE**</p> <p>Hack2Learn is a bi-monthly CTF (capture the flag) meetup hosted at PASCAL in Portland, OR. PASCAL is an organization of equal opportunity hackers, and we will be introducing you to various types of reverse engineering and binary challenges that you might face at any level, and at any time in the fields of information security and technology as a whole, for fun or profit.<br/>Hacker/Tech culture and community can sometimes be a bit (or a byte ^_^) off-putting, especially to those trying to figure out what exactly it is, what we are and what we do. During this meetup at PASCAL, we welcome n00bs with open arms! Never competed in a CTF challenge before? Never even heard of CTFs? Do you have a strong desire to learn &amp; teach alongside peers? GOOD!! You will fit right in at Hack2Learn!</p> <p>For the next several Hack2Learn workshops, we will be taking a crack at Assembly-focused CTF (Capture The Flag) and reversing challenges, specifically microcorruption. MrDe4d will start by giving a short presentation on a particular aspect of the theory behind ASM (last time we talked about ISRs in MSP430 MCUs). The goal of the presentation prior to the challenge is to (hopefully) help everyone in attendance to gain theoretical as well as practical knowledge.<br/>Being able to gain control of system memory is a powerful skill, and is a gateway to understanding memory structure, how data is accessed and processed, how the OS, CPU and programs interface with one another and ultimately how to pwn. Throughout the series we will cover basic syntax, instructions, conditions, and more! As we dive deeper into each aspect of the challenges, we will continue to reiterate what has been covered with Assembly- we expect questions to be frequent and recurring. It is absolutely OK to ask the same thing more than once; PASCAL Hack2Learn is a friendly learning environment!<br/>H2L has two major goals: for everyone to capture the flags, and to learn to reverse. This is not a workshop focused on learning a tool (though we do use Cutter), rather it is designed to get attendees thinking logically, critically &amp; to get everyone accustomed to being uncomfortable and not knowing the answer.<br/>As we will be focusing on microcorruption CTF challenges for the next several workshops, it is not necessary to have Cutter or any other debugger installed. Microcorruption has its own web based debugger that is very easy to learn and use!</p> <p>Questions? Email [masked] or get on the PASCAL Discord and interact with other PDX hackers (ask for invite).</p>',\n",

Do you think it\\'s too complicated? Are you intimidated by the whole concept of containerization? I answered yes to these questions less than a year ago. Now I cannot start a new project without docker. I have tamed the beast and I am now able to take advantage of all of its benefits. In this talk, I will explain what Docker containers are and outline their benefits. I will also present a simple architecture for developing Django applications. It will include, Django, Mysql, RabbitMQ, Memcache and Nginx all running in separate containers. I will show a demo of how such an application can be deployed to Heroku easily.</p> <p>This meetup is sponsored by:</p> <p>• Festicket (<a href=\"https://festicket.workable.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://festicket.workable.com/</a>): \"Europe\\'s largest music festival platform, and UK\\'s 6th fastest growing private tech start up.<br/>Transforming the way music fans discover, book tickets and travel packages for festivals around the world.\"</p> <p>• Mixcloud (<a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.mixcloud.com/</a>): Mixcloud is an audio streaming platform connecting a global community of listeners and creators through audio culture.<br/>Listeners can access a unique collection of over 15 million radio shows, DJ mixes and podcasts produced and uploaded by over 1.3 million passionate tastemakers and curators around the globe.</p> <p>• Time Out (<a href=\"https://timeout.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://timeout.com/</a>): \"The trusted global platform that inspires and enables people to experience the best of the city.\"</p> <p>• Verve (<a href=\"https://verve.co\" class=\"linkified\">https://verve.co</a>): \"We turn word of mouth into your best sales channel.\"</p>',\n",

Join others who want to see what coding is all about:<br/>Bring laptops and hunger to learn - we will feed you with knowledge and snacks!<br/>Beginners learn to code using Python.<br/>Intermediate coders have Code-wars sessions<br/>Advanced coders join teams and build their own projects (games, IoT, whatever).</p> <p>If you\\'re a member of this Meetup, feel free to join our slack group:<br/><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codewarsacademy/shared_invite/enQtNDIzNTE4Mjk5NzUwLTI0NTRkMDk4ZTU5OWEyODRhZDA4ZTUzOTA5MzJjYmQ5MmYyZWNkZDI1YzU1Y2U5Yzg4M2FhYzUyM2M5MGM3ODU\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codewarsacademy/shared_invite/enQtNDIzNTE4Mjk5NzUwLTI0NTRkMDk4ZTU5OWEyODRhZDA4ZTUzOTA5MzJjYmQ5MmYyZWNkZDI1YzU1Y2U5Yzg4M2FhYzUyM2M5MGM3ODU</a></p>',\n",

Jeder Interessierte kann einfach kommen, es ist keine Anmeldung oder dergleichen notwendig - bislang haben wir noch immer alle gut untergebracht, auch wenn es schon ein paar Mal ganz schön eng war.</p> <p>Die geplanten Themen sind:</p> <p>- \"Erfahrungen mit einer Protokollimplementierung auf Basis Boost.ASIO\" von Georg Hellack<br/>- \"Buffer-Overflows\" von Sven Johannsen<br/>- \"Live Coding Small Object Optimization (SOO)\" von Daniel Evers (Hauptvortrag)</p> <p>wir treffen uns in Aachen alle 2 Monate am 2. Donnerstag im Monat um 19:00 Uhr.</p> <p>(siehe auch: <a href=\"http://www.wilkening-online.de/programmieren/c++-treffen-aachen.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.wilkening-online.de/programmieren/c++-treffen-aachen.html</a>)</p> <p>Wir treffen uns abwechselnd in den Räumen der Firmen Schlumberger, Inform und National Instrument, Utimaco und ModuleWorks.</p> <p>Motivation: Das C++ User-Treffen soll Interessierten eine Möglichkeit bieten, Gleichgesinnte zu treffen und mit ihnen aktuelle Probleme, Entwicklungen und Ideen rund um C++ zu diskutieren, und ein Netzwerk um die Programmier-Sprache C++ aufzubauen. Außerdem soll mit den Vorträgen das Wissen von und um C++ erweitert werden können.</p> <p>Ablauf: Die Treffen sollen jedesmal rund 2 Stunden dauern, d.h. bis ungefähr 22:00 Uhr. Im Normallfall soll der Anfang aus 2-4 kleinen Lightning-Vorträgen (5-10 Minuten) bestehen - denen sich dann ein Haupt-Event anschließt. Die Lightning-Vorträge und Haupt-Events können Vorträge, Life-Codings, Tool-Vorstellung, Workshops, Quiz und andere Aktionen sein - solange sie sich primär um C++ drehen. Nach dem Haupt-Event ist dann hoffentlich immer noch genug Raum und Zeit für weitere Diskussionen vorhanden. Am Anfang jedes Treffens werden wir versuchen, die Themen für das nächste Treffen festzulegen - und damit kommen wir zu dem vielleicht wichtigsten Thema, der Beteiligung...</p> <p>1) Jeden Monat, außer Weihnachten und in den Sommerferien, so dass wir auf 10 Treffen pro Jahr kommen.</p> <p>Schlumberger</p> <p>Schlumberger (<a href=\"http://www.slb.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.slb.com/</a>)<br/>Ritterstr. 23<br/>52072 Aachen<br/>2.

Do you think it\\'s too complicated? Are you intimidated by the whole concept of containerization? I answered yes to these questions less than a year ago. Now I cannot start a new project without docker. I have tamed the beast and I am now able to take advantage of all of its benefits. In this talk, I will explain what Docker containers are and outline their benefits. I will also present a simple architecture for developing Django applications. It will include, Django, Mysql, RabbitMQ, Memcache and Nginx all running in separate containers. I will show a demo of how such an application can be deployed to Heroku easily.</p> <p>This meetup is sponsored by:</p> <p>• Festicket (<a href=\"https://festicket.workable.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://festicket.workable.com/</a>): \"Europe\\'s largest music festival platform, and UK\\'s 6th fastest growing private tech start up.<br/>Transforming the way music fans discover, book tickets and travel packages for festivals around the world.\"</p> <p>• Mixcloud (<a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.mixcloud.com/</a>): Mixcloud is an audio streaming platform connecting a global community of listeners and creators through audio culture.<br/>Listeners can access a unique collection of over 15 million radio shows, DJ mixes and podcasts produced and uploaded by over 1.3 million passionate tastemakers and curators around the globe.</p> <p>• Time Out (<a href=\"https://timeout.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://timeout.com/</a>): \"The trusted global platform that inspires and enables people to experience the best of the city.\"</p> <p>• Verve (<a href=\"https://verve.co\" class=\"linkified\">https://verve.co</a>): \"We turn word of mouth into your best sales channel.\"</p>',\n",

The traditional version control performed by the human hand, for example, the file named \"version[masked]\", \"version[masked]\", the process will be very complicated, and easy to make mistakes, it will be more confusing when many people develop together.</p> <p>We talked about how software developers use Git to track and maintain changes to the source code to manage the different versions that appear in the development process, and to increase efficiency in multiplayer development.</p> <p>Please visit our YouTube channel when you arrive. Participate in the 1-hour live teaching video and we will answer your questions in real time.</p> <p>We will mention:<br/>History of version control</p> <p>Git definition of the version</p> <p>Using Git\\'s software development process</p> <p>Multi-person cooperation development process</p> <p>Git and GitHub</p> <p>How to participate in the open source project on GitHub</p> <p>Who should attend:<br/>Newcomer to programming, want to know Git</p> <p>People who are interested in version control</p>',\n",

We have spent a lot of effort trying to make this year\\'s edition even better than last year\\'s.</p> <p>About<br/>PyGrunn is the \\'Python and friends\\' conference with a local footprint and global mindset. Firmly rooted in the open source culture it aims to provide the leading lights in advanced internet technologies a platform to inform, inspire and impress their peers. But the most important part is of course hanging out with peers. PyGrunn has a non-commercial character and tickets are just 35 euro, which is only for covering the costs of food, drinks and an already legendary t-shirt. Days chock-full of pyhon/geek/hacker fun don\\'t come much cheaper than that! Still in doubt? Ask someone who visited a previous edition.</p> <p>Speaking opportunity<br/>Got a great Python story to tell? This is your chance to do so in front of a friendly and enthousiastic audience of over 250 Pythonistas! You can find the RFP for submitting your proposal at www.pygrunn.org (<a href=\"http://www.pygrunn.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pygrunn.org/</a>).</p> <p>Location<br/>Just as last year this year\\'s edition will take place on May 13th at Groninger Forum (Hereplein 4-5, Groningen (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@53.2138293,6.5692434,3a,75y,37.81h,96.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sToK90ycBeI2DrKjcQuM3-Q!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DToK90ycBeI2DrKjcQuM3-Q%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D392%26h%3D106%26yaw%3D156.65404%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-US\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/maps/@53.2138293,6.5692434,3a,75y,37.81h,96.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sToK90ycBeI2DrKjcQuM3-Q!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DToK90ycBeI2DrKjcQuM3-Q%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D392%26h%3D106%26yaw%3D156.65404%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-US</a>)). So yes, once again you will be able to enjoy the talks from the comfort of a cinema chair.</p> <p>Tickets<br/>Tickets are already on sale at www.pygrunn.org (<a href=\"http://www.pygrunn.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pygrunn.org/</a>). There are only 250 tickets available and they will be sold out for sure, so don\\'t hesitate. The 50 euro should not hold you back. Optionally, you can indicate your attendance at the PyGrunn Meetup (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/PyGrunn\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/PyGrunn</a>). But don’t forget to buy a ticket as well.</p> <p>Sponsors<br/>Since PyGrunn has a non-commercial character it depends on sponsors. As always Media2B &amp; Hugo will cover a lot of the expenses, and we are excited by the growing number of business sponsors. Still, we would love to see more sponsors supporting the PyGrunn community. So be sure to check if your company could become a sponsor.</p> <p>Spread the word and we hope to see you all at this year\\'s PyGrunn! In the meantime follow us on Twitter (@pygrunn (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pygrunn\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pygrunn</a>)) and www.pygrunn.org (<a href=\"http://www.pygrunn.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.pygrunn.org/</a>).</p> <p>On behalf of the organizing committee,<br/>Berco Beute &amp; Sietse van der Laan</p>',\n",

It can lead to breakthroughs in science, and deeper understanding of our history and environment. Businesses are eager to maximise their competitive advantage by better understanding data about their own processes, and the market they work in.</p> <p>Data science - the combination of maths, coding, visualisation, data technology, and ideas from artificial intelligence - is a a valuable skill, in great demand and highly rewarded.</p> <p>These workshops will provide a taster for doing data science with Python.</p> <p>----</p> <p>These workshops are aimed primarily at children aged 7 - 17.</p> <p>Three levels of project will be provided:<br/>* a gentle introduction for young or new beginners<br/>* an interesting task for children with some coding experience<br/>* an exciting astronomy themed challenge for more confident students with school-level science</p> <p>Teachers and parents are also most welcome to join in and start to explore Python and Data Science.</p> <p>No previous experience is required, and guidance will be provided for everyone. The aim is to leave with more than you came in with!</p> <p>----</p> <p>Practical Stuff</p> <p>To ensure everything runs smoothly, please note the following:</p> <p>* All children will need to be accompanied by parents / carers at all times.<br/>* Please bring a fully charged laptop with working wifi and a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Access to a power socket is not guaranteed.<br/>* We have some spare laptops for use in these workshops for children that don't have access to one - get in touch to reserve one.<br/>* Each participant will need a Google Account. You can create one for free. There is no software to be installed.<br/>* These are free workshops, there is no charge for attending.<br/>* Water and some fruit will be provided at the workshops as a healthy refreshment.</p> <p>----</p> <p>Contact</p> <p>If you have any questions, you can contact Tariq by email coderdojocornwall at gmail dot com.</p>\",\n",

We believe that anyone can learn how to code. However, finishing Free Code Camp takes time, lots of time. =)<br/>Rate of failures in Free Code Camp is high. We came across a blog which reflects typical roadblocks while doing Free Code Camp and the writer has sound advice for those who want to enter the world of coding.

His main area of concern is driver behavior analysis. His work involves statistical analysis and modeling, signal processing, sensor fusion for mobile phones, machine learning, and related techniques.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The field of driver behavior analysis has attracted a lot of attention in recent times. Automobile and Insurance companies are specifically interested in the driving patterns of their customers. We hypothesized that it is possible to analyze driving patterns using the sensors of the smartphone. The process involves signal processing, sensor fusion and noise removal, event detection, and analysis during trips. It is further required to score drivers and map their daily driving to the propensity of collision. This requires statistical scoring and modeling. I work with a team of extremely bright statisticians, engineers and data scientists who make all of this possible.</p> <p>ODSC Links:<br/>• Get free access to more talks like this at LearnAI:<br/><a href=\"https://learnai.odsc.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://learnai.odsc.com/</a><br/>• Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/</a><br/>• Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odsc\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/odsc</a> &amp; @odsc<br/>• LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/</a><br/>• India Conference Aug 7 - 10: <a href=\"https://india.odsc.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://india.odsc.com/</a><br/>• West Conference Oct 29 - Nov 1: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/california\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/california</a><br/>• Europe Conference Nov 19 - 22: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/london\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/london</a></p>',\n",

In today’s interviews, candidates are expected to write code on the board and explain the complexity of algorithms and in some cases propose improvements. In such cases, it is not only important to learn the algorithms and data structures, but also build a strong foundation. The aim of this course is to teach the fundamentals and also techniques to solve problems under time crunch of an interview.</p> <p>This course spans over seven consecutive Saturdays.We will meet for 4-hours every Saturday from 1 pm to 5 pm. The sessions will be held on May 11th, May 18th, May 25th, June 1st, June 8th, June 15th, and June 22nd.</p> <p>We will cover the following topics:</p> <p>Big-O notation,<br/>Linked list,<br/>Stacks,<br/>Queues,<br/>Heaps,<br/>Arrays and strings,<br/>Recursion,<br/>Sorting and searching,<br/>Trees,<br/>Graphs and<br/>Dynamic programming.</p> <p>All the training will be held at HackerDojo, 3350 Thomas Rd #150, Santa Clara, CA 95054.</p> <p>In every session, we will discuss algorithms, then we will use the algorithms and solve a few problems. We will discuss pseudo code which can be easily converted to code. The attendees can then write code using language of their choice. All the sessions will be recorded, and attendees will have access to the videos and can revise the material at their own time. The video hosting site will also have ability to discuss the material offline with other fellow attendees. Every week, a few problems from LeetCode will be assigned and the solutions will be discussed in the following class. Attendees will have plenty of opportunity to ask questions.</p> <p>Once you register, you will be provided a list of pre-class material. It is recommended to review the pre-class material to take full advantage of this course.</p> <p>Instructor\\'s Bio - Dr. Ravi Chityala is a Senior Engineer at Elekta Inc.

All programming languages and levels of experience are welcome.</p> <p>Please write down or save my phone number (listed above when you are logged in), since you may need to call/text me to find the group. See below for parking information.</p> <p>This meetup will be a self-directed programming session without a fixed plan or leader. Just bring whatever tutorials, books, courses, or projects that you\\'re working on. You can meet people, find a partner for pair programming, talk about technology, find/create a study group, work on a personal or group project, or just study a book or tutorial. It\\'s very informal.</p> <p>Optional activities: if you want to work on coding puzzles, projects, and/or study groups with other attendees, let an organizer know when you arrive.</p> <p>Tip: we meet twice per week in Berkeley. Check out the main calendar for a list of events, and learn more about the group at <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/</a></p> <p>The meetups are free to attend, but please remember to buy a drink or pastry when you arrive at the cafe so that they stay happy about our meeting there. If you\\'re hungry, they also serve full meals in the back.</p> <p>Parking Information: parking in Downtown Berkeley can sometimes be difficult, because of the construction. It\\'s often easier to park at a nearby BART station and then take a train one stop to Downtown Berkeley. North Berkeley BART Station and Ashby BART Station are good options on Saturdays. The parking there is free on weekends, so you get all-day parking for the price of a round-trip BART ticket (less than $4). See the parking page for more information: <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/parking/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/parking/</a></p>',\n",

It is approachable so if you already know HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then you are ready to start building things in no time!</p> <p>It is versatile. It has an incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.</p> <p>It is also performant with a small file size of only 20KB minified and zipped. It is equipped with blazing fast virtual DOM and minimal optimization efforts.</p> <p>In prep for this event:</p> <p>1. Bring your laptop</p> <p>2. Download a text editor such as Sublime Text 3 (<a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sublimetext.com</a>) or Atom (<a href=\"https://atom.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://atom.io</a>) (you can download this for free).</p> <p>3.

       "  'description': '<p>Java (Backend) Study Group is happening at Quipper this May 11, 2019. If you want to learn more about Java, come and join us. Thank you Rosalie Rioja for leading our Java study group this week.</p> <p>Please answer this form so we can move you from Waitlist to RSVP - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wwcodemanilaevents-May112019\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/wwcodemanilaevents-May112019</a></p> <p>Please RSVP before Friday - 5:00 pm. We need to submit the names of the members who will be attending the event by Friday. Please bring ID. Thank you.</p> <p>Community get-together: 3:00-3:30 pm<br/>Event proper starts: 3:30 pm</p> <p>-------------------------------------<br/>Why Java for Backend?</p> <p>Platform independence</p> <p>One of the main reasons Java is so popular is its platform independence, which means that Java programs can be run on many different types of computers. A Java program runs on any computer with a Java Runtime Environment, also known as a JRE, installed. A JRE is available for almost every type of computer — PCs running Windows, Macintosh computers, Unix or Linux computers, huge mainframe computers, and even cell phones.</p> <p>Object orientation</p> <p>Java is inherently object-oriented, which means that Java programs are made up of programming elements called objects. Simply put, an object is a programming entity that represents either some real-world object or an abstract concept.</p> <p>******</p> <p>In prep for this event:</p> <p>- Install Java<br/>(<a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>)<br/>- Any text editor (Notepad++ or Sublime is recommended)<br/>- Any IDE (Netbeans or Eclipse) is okay too</p> <p>This study group is intended for beginners and even those with zero-knowledge in programming. Everyone is welcome! :)</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>NOTE: If you haven\\'t set up in prep for the event, please be there at least 30 mins to prep your machine. The team will be there to assist you.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>What is a Technical Study Group?</p> <p>Women Who Code Technical Study Groups are events where women can come together and help each other learn and understand a specific programming language, technology, or anything related to coding or engineering.</p> <p>We welcome developers of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting.

       "  'description': '<p>This Saturday at PASCAL we are offering a Hacker Symposium of sorts, featuring a few handy tools of the trade as well as two major frameworks often used in developing exploits and attacking systems or networks. We will be surveying several of the tools that are part of Kali, and easy to install on any Debian derived distro. It seems many folks, sometimes even the professionals already hip deep in the field of tech, are unaware of the power their packages wield! The wild hacker kidz at PASCAL are going to show you how to get started with packaged/pre-loaded tools like Burp Suite, Binwalk, Wireshark, Kismet and will also provide you with an overview of the Metasploit and Volatility frameworks. Come take your first step with Reverse Engineering at PASCAL using Binwalk! Excuse yourself and set up a proxy with Burp Suite! Breath deep and sniff packets with Kismet! Enjoy these puns and more, in person with Cylon and the rest of the misfit hackers of PDX!</p> <p>We will set aside time to answer questions, and hold demonstrations of each utility discussed. This is all about what YOU want to learn!! Questions? please email Cylon--&gt; [masked]. PASCAL also has a Discord server as means of communication regarding upcoming events, news in infosec and memes (inquire within).<br/>If you RSVP and are no longer able to make it, please do take the time to change your RSVP so that someone else may attend, even if it is only an hour before! Thanks!</p>',\n",

The idea is to ease the learning process for beginners and to create bonds between advanced Pythonistas in order to be able to tackle larger projects.<br/>All you need to bring is a laptop. If you want to also bring a question¹, a cool piece of code² or a project pitch³, feel free to do that either impromptu or share a (for now power-point) slide with us on the slack⁴ beforehand.</p> <p>if you have never coded before and would like help with setting up Python and get a few pointers on how to start, we ask you to please join one of our intro-sessions⁵, before joining these meetings.</p> <p>Doors open at 12.30 and we start the group activities (question, code share, project pitches and co-working sessions) at 13.00 and we wrap up around 17.00. Afterwards, we sometimes go to Delft to grab some beers.</p> <p>If you have any questions, feel free to use the comment section below. You can also request to join our Slack⁴ channel there or via direct message here on meetup.</p> <p>Please also check out the groups page for more details and events: <a href=\"https://meetup.com/Pythonistas-NL\" class=\"linkified\">https://meetup.com/Pythonistas-NL</a></p> <p>¹ Please prepare a \"Minimal (not) working example\": <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example</a><br/>² Usually we use something like 15 lines here. This can be pretty much anything; for example a cool use-case of a library, some weird Python magic or some clever bit banging.<br/>³ We try to find projects, that are solvable within ~20 minutes to get to know some of the other Pythonistas.<br/>⁴ <a href=\"https://pythonistas-nl.slack.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://pythonistas-nl.slack.com</a><br/>⁵ to be announced</p>',\n",
